# Part 1: Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Code: Build an artificial neural network from scratch and code how it performs predictions using forward propagation


# Part 2: Basics of Deep Learning
In this part, you will learn about the gradient descent algorithm, backpropagation, and how neural networks learn and update their weights and biases. You will learn about the vanishing gradient problem. Finally, you will learn about activation functions.

- Code: Mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by using a ReLU activation function


# Part 3: Keras and Deep Learning Libraries
In this part, you will learn about some of the different deep learning libraries avaiCodele and how to build regression and classification models using the Keras library.
- Code: Use the Keras library to build a regression model and build a model for classification problems


# Part 4: Deep Learning Models
In this part, you will learn about the difference between shallow and deep neural networks, learn about convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks, and about transformers and autoencoders.
- Code: Use the Keras library to build convolutional neural networks and build a transformer model
